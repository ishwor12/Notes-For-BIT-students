    What is stack? What is different application of stack? Trace out Infix to postfix conversion algorithm with given Infix expression. A + (((B-C) * (D-E) + F)/G) $ (H-I) Evaluate the postfix expression acquired from above for the given values: A = 6, B = 2, C = 4, D = 3, E = 8, F = 2, G = 3, H = 5, I = 1.
